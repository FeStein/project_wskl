# VOT Dataset
This folder contains some experiments with the VOT dataset. The dataset is
tailored towards object recognition in videos and maybe small videos can be used
to quickly benchmark the results I obtain from implementing the different
algorithms.

## Installing the VTO Dataset
Just run the install script via
```bash
source init_vot.sh
```
Note that I used the zsh shell, that may differ. In addition modify your conda
environment name accordingly (*vot* is default).

This will create a new conda environment (if it doesn't exist already) download
the vot setup python package and will initialize a new vot2019 workspace.
