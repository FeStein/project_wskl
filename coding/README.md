# coding
This folder contains some temporary coding scripts and snippets I'm trying to
implement. Mostly not working, otherwise it would already be in the *src/*
folder.

## learning/

In this folder, i will keep some (simple) scripts I write in order to learn the
tools I need.

### detect_hand.py

Detecting hands from video streams (using a sample video stream of myself).
Following along with [Sentdex Tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/haar-cascade-face-eye-detection-python-opencv-tutorial/).
Currently not working. Hands are probably too complex in order to detect them by
a simple filter (changing shapes).
