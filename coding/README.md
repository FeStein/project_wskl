# coding
This folder contains some temporary coding scripts and snippets I'm trying to
implement. Mostly not working, otherwise it would already be in the *src/*
folder.

## learning/

In this folder, i will keep some (simple) scripts I write in order to learn the
tools I need.

### detect_face.py

Detecting the face and parts the face from video streams (using a sample video
stream of myself). Following along with 
[Sentdex Tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/haar-cascade-face-eye-detection-python-opencv-tutorial/).
Stuff is based on haar feature-based Cascade Classifiers. Theory is given in the OpenCV
[Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html).
