# Scripts
This folder contains a number of useful scripts I use. They are mostly tailored
on my machines so i can work quick (Mac OS/ Ubuntu 20.04) so don't expect them
to work at your machine.

* **create_conda_env.sh** - bash script to quickly set up an conda environment
    containing all the prerequisites necessary for this project to work. Conda
    should be installed, please set name variable first.
