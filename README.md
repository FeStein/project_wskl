# README
This is the project folder associated to the thesis I am writing at
[WSKL](https://www.mv.uni-kl.de/wskl/). At the current state this is a very
early draft status and i will experiment quiet a lot. Don't expect anything to
work properly in this status.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.9 (lower will be suitable too i guess but that's what I currently use)
* OpenCV - I built it using anaconda along with an virtual environment: 
 [opencv on conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv)
